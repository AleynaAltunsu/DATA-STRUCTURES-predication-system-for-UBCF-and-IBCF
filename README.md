Project Report:
For the following Predication system for UBCF and IBCF, we use Hashing and  map data  structure  for  rating  and  for  top  rated  movies.  In  the program Firstly, main method send “train.csv","test.csv","result.csv"as parameter to the Predication Class when an object,in this case p, creates. It automatically start print the predicted ratings into the result.csv. And then this constructor does all the job when an object created, example call ReadDatamethod to read the traim.csv's dataand call Writemethod to write on result.csv.UsersListand ItemsListis an unordered-map that stores  an  integer  and  an  UsersList  typeand ItemsList  type. Similarityfunction is a representation of cosine similarity.ReadMethod:All the data in trainfile and testfile are string eventhought they seem like numbers,  we  will  read  strings, the  first  column  in traifile  is  useless, because  of  that  we  need  to  skip  the  first  line, we  store  the  ratings  for users in UsersListand we store the rating for items in ItemsList. Write Method:To writes the results, the first column in traindata is useless because of thatwe need to skip the first line, to use the ubcf and ibcf together, this variable     takes     both     the     results     from     CalculaterUBCF()     and CalculaterIBCF()add them eachothers and divided by 2.
SimilarityUBCF function:Is  the function  calculates  the  ubcf  similarity  to  find  the  most  accurate rating  with  ubcf, iterator  is  usefull  to  travelling  inside  the  map,  and  it does start from the beginning of the user1map(and user2map). And send the vectors into the similarity() to check the cosine value.SimilarityIBCFfunction:Is  thefunction  calculates  the  ibcf  similarity  to  find  the  most  accurate rating with ibcf, does the same thing just like the SimilarityUBCF().CalculateerIBCFFunction:To  calculate  the  rating  via  ubcf, as  the  similarityIBCF's  value  for  itemidthis  piece  of  code  is  to  faster  the  loop  because  its  only  checks  for  the most similar ones (0.90).CalculaterUBFCFunction:To calculate the rating via ibcf, it does the same thing as CalculaterIBCF.Top10 Function:To print top10 users and top10 items, store the every single itemidand userid, all  the  data  in  trainfile  and  testfile  are  string  eventhought  they seem number we will read strings, the first column in traindata is useless because of that we need to skip the first line, reads the train.csv, for the top10 itemsa vector will store top10Items.And that’s how the program will print the top ten rated items.
